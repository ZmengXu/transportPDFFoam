 @section requirements Requirements
 In the following the prerequisite software packages are listed:

 - OpenFOAM: Versions 1.7.x or 2.1.x have been tested. OpenFOAM-extend has not
   been tried at all. Installation instructions are available from the official
   OpenFOAM [download page](http://openfoam.org/download).
 - A operating system that is compatible with OpenFOAM. These include popular
   Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE and Fedora. Mac OS X works
   with a lot of hackery. Simply forget about MS Windows. Refer to the OpenFOAM
   installation instructions on version requirements. The requirements can
 - usually be relaxed when compiling OpenFOAM from source, but that is not for
   the inexperienced.
 - A C++ compiler that is compatible with OpenFOAM. For OpenFOAM 1.7.x these
   are g++ versions 4.2 to 4.6. For OpenFOAM 2.1.x this should be g++ 4.3
   through 4.7 and fairly recent versions of Clang.
 - GNU Make

 On Debian based distributions, the following commands will install OpenFOAM
 1.7.1 (the version best tested) and all other dependencies:

 @code{.sh}
 sudo sh -c "echo deb http://www.openfoam.com/download/ubuntu maverick main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openfoam171.list"
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install openfoam171 paraviewopenfoam381
 @endcode

 In case you are using OpenFOAM 10.04 LTS, replace @c maverick with @c lucid in
 above commands.

 If you want to genereate the Doxygen documentation, you also will need:

 - Doxygen
 - GNU Sed
 - GNU Awk
 - Graphviz
 - LaTeX: Depending on the version of Doxygen, you need a LaTeX distribution
   with @ dvipng installed. This is only necessary if your Doxygen doesn't
   support MathJax and loading of MathJax-extensions for formula rendering.
   Doxygen version 1.7.5 and newer should do.

 On Debian based distributision, the following will install these packages
 (excluding LaTeX):

 @code{.sh}
 sudo apt-get install doxygen sed gawk graphviz
 @endcode

 The tutorial cases use Python Matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org) to create the
 graphs. Version 1.2.0 or newer is required. Unfortunately, e.g. the current
 Ubuntu 12.10 only provides version 1.1.1. To install a newer version without
 affecting the one installed by the system, @c virtualenv can be used to create
 an isolated Python installation where the package can be updated:

 @code{.sh}
 sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
 virtualenv --system-site-packages $HOME/Software/python
 source $HOME/Software/python/bin/activate
 echo "source $HOME/Software/python/bin/activate" >> ~/.bash_profile
 pip install --upgrade matplotlib
 @endcode

 @section building Building
 In order to compile the library @c mcParticle and the pdfSimpleFoam
 solver, in the top-level source directory issue the following command:

 @code{.sh}
 ./Allwmake
 @endcode

 To build the documentation, use instead

 @code{.sh}
 ./Allwmake doc
 @endcode
