Dr. Vladimir Zamansky of Energy and Environmental Research has brought 
to our attention the following error in the initial release of GRI-Mech 
2.1. The 'E' terms in the rate constant expressions for reactions (277) 
NH3 + H = NH2 + H2 and (278) NH3 + OH = NH2 + H2O should be positive 
rather than negative as originally given.  The mechanism file has been 
corrected as of November 4, 1995, and the corrected version is referred 
to as GRI-Mech 2.11.  This change does not affect our results 
because the mechanism was not designed for ammonia or deNOx kinetics, 
and none of the targets chosen for the 2.1 version or validation 
experiments tested afterwards show measurable sensitivity to these 
reactions.  Recalculation of all targets and validation experiments has 
been done with GRI-Mech 2.11 (completed November 21, 1995).  No
significant changes from the results obtained using GRI-Mech 2.1 were found.
The files in this directory are products of computational and experimental
research sponsored by the Gas Research Institute. Previous mechanism and
readme files are available. In particular, you can consult the README12.DAT
file for a description of the hydrocarbon oxidation mechanism, GRI-Mech 1.2,
and its performance in validation tests. The hydrocarbon part of
GRI-Mech 1.2, with the single exception mentioned below, has been retained
intact in GRI-Mech 2.11.

The research was carried out at The Pennsylvania State University, Stanford
University, The University of California, Berkeley, The University of Texas
at Austin, and SRI International.

GRI-Mech is an optimized (see below) detailed chemical reaction mechanism
capable of the best representation of natural gas flames, ignition, and NOx
formation and reburning in natural gas combustion that we are able to
provide as of the date at the head of this file.

In order to use the input files directly you need the Sandia National
Laboratory "Chemkin-II" programs. (See discussion below.) Ignition and flow
reactor profiles and well-stirred reactor outputs calculated with this mechanism
and thermochemical data should be independent of the program used to compute
them; noticeable small differences in flame profiles should be expected if you
use a flame code other than Premix, however, because the transport calculation,
the numerical method of solving the partial differential equations, and so on,
differ from program to program.

1. WHAT IS GRI-Mech 2.11?

What follows is a brief overview of the GRI-Mech 2.11 enhancement to the
version 1.2 release. Consult the README file for GRI-Mech 1.2 for general
information about GRI-Mech.

GRI-Mech 2.11 is a compilation of 276 elementary chemical reactions and
associated rate coefficient expressions and thermochemical parameters for
the 49 species involved in them.

It differs from the version 1.2 release in that it includes nitrogen chemistry
relevant to natural gas chemistry and reburning. The version 2.11 data files
serve the same purposes as those of the version 1.2 release and they serve them
in exactly the same way. If you have the Chemkin programs, all you need to do
is substitute the GRI-Mech 2.11 input files for whatever files you have working
with Chemkin before and you will be ready to go.

2. VERSION 2.11 PERFORMANCE THAT WE KNOW ABOUT

We test the performance of GRI-Mech extensively. The performance of version 1.2,
containing the C-H-O parts of natural gas ignition and flame chemistry, is
described in the README12.DAT file. Version 2.11 contains the identical chemistry
as in version 1.2 plus 99 reactions of 17 additional nitrogen-containing species.
The parameters of the 177 reactions in version 1.2 were not varied in the course
of the Version 2.11 optimization process except for the rate coefficient of the
CH + H2O --> H + CH2O reaction, which was found to play an important role in
prompt NO formation but to have no effect on the course of the carbon-hydrogen-
oxygen chemistry of methane combustion. Version 2.11 is therefore identical to
version 1.2 with respect to the carbon-hydrogen-oxygen chemistry of natural gas
ignition and flames. Version 2.11 was not optimized for modeling pure nitrogen-
hydrogen-oxygen chemistry or any form of NOx removal process except for
reburning.

In the course of developing GRI-Mech 2.11 we learned quite early that optimizing
the nitrogen chemistry relevant to natural gas flames and reburning is
qualitatively a very different challenge than optimizing the carbon-
hydrogen-oxygen chemistry. In the first place, we were able to locate only a
much smaller data base of experimental information from which to draw
optimization targets. Then, once the modeling process had proceeded far
enough that we could examine matches between computed and observed
behavior, we found a far higher degree of discord among the matches to
targets and other data than we had seen in working with our earlier
optimizations of carbon-hydrogen-oxygen chemistry. We therefore have to
caution users of GRI-Mech 2.11 to regard it only a preliminary starting point
that can not be applied with anything like the degree of confidence that can
be attached to the version 1.2 carbon-hydrogen-oxygen chemistry. We do
believe that GRI-Mech 2.11 is a signficant improvement over previous attempts to
describe NOx formation and reburning for example the 1989 Miller and Bowman
mechanism, and are therefore releasing it at this time in the spirit of
"beta testing" our first optimized result and stimulating further experimental
study of NOx formation and removal in natural gas flames.

Here is a list of the validation checks of Version 2.11 that we have made.
Examining the comparisons between prediction and observation, provided in
graphical form on our World Wide Web site, will show you pretty quickly how
well GRI-Mech 2.11 performs.

3. PLEASE  TELL  US  WHAT  YOU  LEARN,  AND  ABOUT  YOUR PROBLEMS

While the authors are continuing to expand their understanding of how
GRI-Mech works, it is only natural that others will see things that should be
done with quite different perspectives.  We would very much like to hear
from you.

We want to hear about your experiences with GRI-Mech, both successes and
failures.  It will help us more in our development work, and consequently all
users of our later releases, to hear about failures.  We welcome suggestions of
any kind. Please be as specific as you can in telling us about your results
and your problems.  We will be happy to include the results of your "validation
runs", with appropriate citation to you, in our printed materials.

We are especially interested in maintaining a list of users, so that we can
quickly communicate changes, problems, and updates.

Since our ftp daemon does not record actual usernames, we request that those
who are considering use of the mechanism send us their e-mail addresses.
Please address them to SMITH@MPLVAX.SRI.COM.

5. SOME CAUTIONARY NOTES

First we want to warn you about several general aspects of GRI-Mech.

a. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ANY SUBSTITUTIONS!

Or if you MUST so, be very careful. GRI-Mech has been optimized as a whole,
and should be used just as you receive it if you want to duplicate its ability
to model natural gas combustion and NO formation and removal.

You likely will not surpass the performance we obtained for natural gas
combustion and NO formation and removal by the independent adjustment of any
"sensitive" reaction rate parameters.

Any substitution of "better" rate coefficient expressions or removal of
species or reactions may lead to your getting significantly deteriorated
performance of the mechanism when tested against the whole spectrum of natural
gas combustion and NO data.

We recognize that GRI-Mech users are human and will adjust rate coefficients or
make major changes for specific purposes, such as doing sensitivity analyses.
When doing this please keep in mind that we do not claim that GRI-Mech is
suitable as a starting point for mechanism development by patchwork means.
We cannot predict what the consequences may be.

b. NUMBERS OF SPECIES AND REACTIONS.

The list of reactions and species in GRI-Mech 2.11 contains entries that are
"unimportant" for natural gas combustion and NO formation and removal
for the conditions investigated to date.

There are several reasons why we have them there. One is that there are special
purposes (like models of flame radiation or pollutant emissions) where
elementary reactions that are otherwise negligible become important, and we
want to have these reactions on hand for such occasions. A second reason is
that the combustion of some other fuels (methanol, acetylene, ...) can be
modeled using GRI-Mech as a subset, with the knowledge that the part of the
mechanism relevant to natural gas has been optimized in the manner described
in the documentation for GRI-Mech 1.2. [We have not looked into the performance
of the GRI-Mech for any fuels except methane, ethane, hydrogen and carbon
monoxide.]

There are techniques for reducing reaction and species lists that you may want
to use yourself on GRI-Mech 2.11; please see the relevant comments in the
version 1.2 documentation.

c. Back reactions.  We consider all reactions to be reversible, even though
it is clear on thermochemical grounds that negligible reverse flux will
occur in many reactions. If your modeling program requires explicit
inclusion of reverse reactions, GRI-Mech 2.11, as presented in this directory,
will require additional calculations to find out which of them are really 
needed.

d. Computer time. The numerous species and reactions in GRI-Mech, some of which
really do not need to be included for modeling natural gas combustion and NO
formation and removal, increase the demand on computer resources for doing the
chemical part of the model by a large factor.  We accept this in order to avoid
coping with the numerous problems that arise in streamlining such
computations.  Computer time has not been a problem for us even when using
GRI-Mech on small workstations and fast PCs.
