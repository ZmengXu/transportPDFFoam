# Transported JPDF Library and Solver for Reactive Flow Simulation

pdfFoam is a general purpose JPDF algorithm for the simulation of turbulent
reactive flows in OpenFOAM. The algorithms, its implementation and the
validation test cases are described in detail in the authors PhD thesis
[[Wild2013]](doc/references.md#Wild2013).

## Installation

### Documentation
Some documentation is directly available as Markdown:
[doc/README.md](doc/README.md). The code, however, is documented extensively
with Doxygen. Refer to below instructions for details on how to build it.

### Requirements

In the following the prerequisite software packages are listed:

- OpenFOAM: Versions 7 have been tested.
