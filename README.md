# transportPDFFoam
Lagrangian particle based Transported Probability Density Function (TPDF) solver and libraries in OpenFOAM.

This code is original from [Michael Wild](https://github.com/wildmichael/pdfFoam), which works in 1.7.x and 2.1.x.

In this repository, the [´pdfFoam´](https://github.com/wildmichael/pdfFoam) is migrated to new OpenFOAM version. I have half tested (only compilation, not run any the case yet) the upgrated code in OpenFOAM-2.3, OpenFOAM-4 and OpenFOAM-7.

The upgrated code are available in the branch of ´of230´, ´of4´ and ´of7´.
